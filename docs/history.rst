History
=======

This breadcrumbs application was originally inspired by two different snippets:

1. `FlatPages trail`_ by **jca**
2. Idea and implementation of universal `breadcrumbs for custom views`_
   by **Thomas Guettler**

.. _FlatPages trail: http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/519/
.. _breadcrumbs for custom views: http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_thread/thread/f40f59e39cef59c4

Then Andrey Mikhaylenko (that's me) wrote a unified extensible templated
breadcrumbs application for both FlatPages and custom views and here it is.
