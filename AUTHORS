Django Navigation was originally created by:

* Andy Mikhailenko <andy@neithere.net>.

Initially the library was based on the snippets by:

* jca
  <http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/519/>
* Thomas Guettler
  <http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_thread/thread/f40f59e39cef59c4>

And here is a probably incomplete list of contributors -- people
who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations and
generally made django-navigation better:

* Mikhail Korobov
* Richard Frankel
* Your Name Here ;)
